Learning CSS by trying to replicate designs found on dribbble

## Concept

This is my attempt at trying to replicate the [Landscape badge](https://dribbble.com/shots/2897512-Landscape-badge) design by [Julien](https://dribbble.com/juliendreamdesign)


[Campus Bike Rider](https://dribbble.com/shots/1882778-Campus-Bike-Rider)  image Â© of [Guy Allen](https://dribbble.com/guy-allen)
